# srj_c_cpp_tricks

This repo's purpose is to act as a quick refresher of c cpp
operations that we don't use often in our jobs but end up appearing
in technical discussions

This is not a repo suitable for learning c cpp from scratch

This repo will be helpful if you are already comfortable with
pointer, pointer to pointer, typecasting, recursion, c structure packing

This repo also plans to discuss cpp STL and posix api in the future

If you are looking to learn the fundamentals from scratch, from my limited knowledge I would suggest

    Programming with C by Byron Gottfried
    C++ Primer by Lippman, Lajoie
    What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory by Ulrich Drepper
    The Lost Art of C Structure Packing by Eric S. Raymond
